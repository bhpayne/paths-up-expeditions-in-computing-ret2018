PATHS-UP and Expeditions in Computing RET 2018

This python code is part of the Rice University PATHS-UP/Expeditions in Computing RET.

Two separate data acquisition channels are available. One uses the CMS D50+ Pulse Oximeter 
and the other uses the Pulse Sensor Amped PPG sensor attached to an Arduino UNO.

The Arduino should be running code from here: 
https://github.com/WorldFamousElectronics/PulseSensorPlayground

Various signal processing projects and hardware explorations were a part of the
Research Experience for Teachers in the summer of 2018.

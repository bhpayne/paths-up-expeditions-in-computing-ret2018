Attribution: Many elements of this code were modified from https://github.com/atbrask/CMS50Dplus

Usage: This script pulls live data from 2 Contech CMS D50+ Pulse Oximeters.
       You must also have the cmsd50plus library in the same location as this script.

       These data could be used to find the pulse transit time with proper processing.

       Serial port: You must know the serial port for both devices. See the function below
       for printing a list of available serial ports.
